# Test Intelligence Integration Guide

The friendly-cicd-helper now includes **Test Intelligence** - an AI-powered feature that analyzes code changes for test quality, coverage gaps, and provides intelligent test suggestions.

## Overview

Test Intelligence combines industry-standard testing tools with AI analysis to:

- **Analyze test coverage** using `coverage.py`
- **Detect test quality issues** and test smells
- **Identify missing test cases** and edge cases
- **Generate AI-powered test suggestions** using Vertex AI
- **Provide actionable recommendations** for improving test quality

## Features

### 1. Test Coverage Analysis
- Uses `coverage.py` to measure test coverage on modified code
- Identifies files with coverage below configurable thresholds
- Highlights specific lines that need test coverage
- Calculates coverage deltas (improvement/degradation)

### 2. Test Quality Assessment
- Detects test smells (overly long tests, weak assertions)
- Identifies tests that test implementation rather than behavior
- Analyzes test isolation and independence
- Provides quality scores and improvement suggestions

### 3. Test Gap Detection
- Identifies complex functions that lack adequate testing
- Detects missing edge case coverage
- Suggests test scenarios for new or modified code
- Recommends test file structure and organization

### 4. AI-Powered Test Generation
- Uses Vertex AI to generate contextual test case suggestions
- Provides specific test method names and scenarios
- Suggests test data and mock requirements
- Offers edge case identification

## CLI Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Analyze test intelligence for a diff

## Cloud Build Integration

The Test Intelligence feature is automatically integrated into Cloud Build pipelines:

```yaml
- id: Test Intelligence Analysis (GITHUB)
  name: 'gcr.io/just-ratio-467615-s1/friendly-cicd-helper:latest'
  entrypoint: sh
  args:
  - -c
  - |
    echo "## ðŸ§ª Test Intelligence Analysis" | tee test-intelligence.md
    echo "_Automated test analysis using coverage.py, pytest, and AI-powered insights_" | tee -a test-intelligence.md
    
    # Run test intelligence analysis with AI suggestions
    friendly-cicd-helper test-intelligence --diff /workspace/diff.txt --format text --generate-tests --coverage-threshold 80 | tee -a test-intelligence.md
    
    # Post results as PR comment
    cat test-intelligence.md | friendly-cicd-helper github-pr-comment --repo $_GITHUB_PROJECT --pr $$(cat /workspace/github_pull_request_iid)
  secretEnv: ['GITHUB_TOKEN']
```

## Issue Types Detected

### Coverage Gaps
- **Low Coverage**: Files below coverage threshold
- **Missing Tests**: Source files with no corresponding test files
- **Uncovered Lines**: Specific lines lacking test coverage

### Test Quality Issues
- **Test Smells**: Long tests, weak assertions, poor structure
- **Poor Isolation**: Tests that depend on each other
- **Implementation Testing**: Tests that test internal implementation details

### Missing Test Cases
- **Complex Functions**: Functions with high cyclomatic complexity
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Integration Points**: API interactions and external dependencies

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Coverage Threshold |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | < 50% coverage | Immediate attention required |
| **High** | 50-70% coverage | Should be addressed soon |
| **Medium** | 70-80% coverage | Improvement recommended |
| **Low** | 80%+ coverage | Minor improvements |

## Dependencies

The Test Intelligence feature requires these Python packages:

```txt
coverage==7.4.0      # Test coverage measurement
pytest==8.0.0        # Test discovery and execution
mutmut==2.4.5        # Mutation testing (future use)
```

## Best Practices

### For Development Teams
1. **Set Appropriate Thresholds**: Start with 70% coverage, increase gradually
2. **Focus on Quality**: Aim for meaningful tests, not just coverage numbers
3. **Use AI Suggestions**: Review and adapt AI-generated test cases
4. **Address High Severity Issues First**: Focus on critical and high-severity findings

### For CI/CD Integration
1. **Run on Every PR**: Include test intelligence in all pull request workflows
2. **Save Reports**: Store JSON reports for trend analysis
3. **Set Gates**: Consider failing builds for critical test issues
4. **Monitor Trends**: Track coverage and quality improvements over time

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Coverage.py

- Verify test files are not ignored by git

**Coverage analysis fails**
- Ensure pytest is properly configured
- Check that source files are importable
- Verify test dependencies are installed

- Check Vertex AI credentials and project setup
- Verify network connectivity
- Ensure diff content is not empty

### Getting Help

For issues with Test Intelligence:
1. Check the logs in Cloud Build or terminal output
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Test with a simple diff file first
4. Review the troubleshooting section above
