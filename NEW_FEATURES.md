# New Feature Proposals

This document outlines new feature proposals for the `friendly-cicd-helper` project.

## 1. Compliance and Governance Checks

**Description:** Introduce a new "compliance-as-code" feature that checks for adherence to organizational standards, best practices, and regulatory requirements. This would involve creating a new `lib/compliance_analyzer.py` module that could check for things like:
*   **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Best Practices:** For Terraform or CloudFormation files, check for common issues like hardcoded secrets, undefined variables, or insecure resource configurations.
*   **Code Licensing:** Scan for incompatible or unlicensed third-party libraries.
*   **Documentation Standards:** Ensure that new code is accompanied by appropriate documentation (e.g., README updates, API documentation).

**Benefits:**
*   Automates compliance checks, reducing manual effort and human error.
*   Improves the security and quality of the codebase.
*   Provides a clear audit trail for compliance purposes.

## 2. Automated Code Refactoring Suggestions

**Description:** Leverage Vertex AI to not only identify code issues but also to suggest and even automatically apply refactoring improvements. This would extend the existing `vertex-code-review` command to provide actionable code snippets that can be applied with user approval.

**Benefits:**
*   Accelerates the code review process by providing concrete, ready-to-use suggestions.
*   Helps to educate developers on best practices and improve their coding skills.
*   Improves code quality and maintainability.

## 3. Cost Analysis and Optimization

**Description:** For changes related to cloud infrastructure (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation), this feature would use Vertex AI to analyze the potential cost impact of the changes. It could provide an estimated cost breakdown and suggest optimizations to reduce spending.

**Benefits:**
*   Provides visibility into the cost implications of infrastructure changes before they are applied.
*   Helps to control cloud spending and avoid unexpected costs.
*   Encourages cost-conscious development practices.

## 4. Enhanced Reporting and Dashboards

**Description:** Create a web-based dashboard that visualizes the results of the various analyses (security, test coverage, compliance) over time. This would provide a high-level overview of the project's health and identify trends.

**Benefits:**
*   Provides a centralized view of the project's quality and security posture.
*   Helps to track progress and identify areas for improvement.
*   Makes it easier to share insights with stakeholders.
